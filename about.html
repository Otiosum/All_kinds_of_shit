        <div>
            <p>Insert short story about how this grand idea came to be. Make idea sound more pretty, to make developers looks smarter. Realise you are making developers look proud for simply creaing all kinds of shit.
            You start to regret what you did. Regrets haunt you in your dreams. You start to lose sleep. You catch yourself being aggressive more and more. One day you wake up because someone is calling you. It is 4 AM in the morning, what are they thinking?
            You pick up your phone to see one of the developers is calling you. You get nervous, but are too tired to care. You answer the phone. The developer tells you how you ruined his career by assosiating him with this project.
            You start to wake up as you fall into sadness. The developer tells you what a horrible person you are and hangs up. You sit there shocked. You considered them a friend once.</p>

            <p>Both developers you have once worked with to create this glorified project, stopped talking to you. You feel alone. The lack of sleep does not help your condition. Your relatives begin to worry about you, but you push them away.
            They don't understand. They don't understand all kinds of shit. Even the developers that worked with you failed to understand. You feel confused. You begin to doubt if you understand. You judge yourself for trying to understand, in silence.</p>

            <p>A year passes. You have spent the year living in a state of limbo. You felt alone, betrayed, and sad about what happened because of all kinds of shit. You realise it has been a year since your fellow developers have stopped
            talking to you. You decide it is time to move on, and celebrate what all kinds of shit helped you accomplish. Didn't it help me lose my friends? You push away this thought. You refuse to feel negative. You are done.
            You think you can celebrate by going to the location of where the idea was born. You try to enter the building where it all began, but are kicked out because you look homeless. You feel sad. You snap out of the sadness again, remembering your earlier promise
            to become more positive. You decide to go to a nearby park to sit on a bench. You think to yourself that this will have to do. All kinds of shit was worth it, so alcohol is justified. You sit on the bench and open your drink.</p>

            <p>Some time passes and you have consumed half of your drink. The deep thoughts you had seem to disappear as you see two people walking towards you. You feel a strange sensation that you are in danger. You decide to not run.
            You developed all kinds of shit, there is nothing to be afraid of. You cannot recognise who the approaching people are. They appear to be carrying bottles. Snap, they might knock you out. You stay brave. The two men aproach and take off their
            hoods. You recognise who they are. You cannot believe who you are seeing. You cannot decide if you should run or stay to see what happens. One of them hands you a bottle. It is beer. You feel a small smile hit your face. It is a nervous smile.
            The drink could be poisoned. You look at the bottle, but it appears to be sealed. However, they could be professionals who used advanced techniques to inject untraceable poison. You feel stupid for going on a tangent. You decide to open the beer as you see
            they have opened their drinks already. You realise that nobody has said a single word yet. You feel like you should say something, but you were not the one who was abandoned. As you open your mouth, one of them finally says:</p>

            <p>"All kinds of shit may have caused conflicts between us in the past, but it is time to put that past behind us."</p>

            <p>These words make you feel inspired. The possibilities of this re-union. The projects that could be accomplished. The days filled with happy and funny conversations, just like the good old times when all kinds of shit was being developed. You lift your arm and tilt the bottle.
            The two developers do the same. You reply, "Very well". You take a drink and so do the two developers. Once everyone finishes their drink, one of them opens their backpack, that you failed to notice earlier, and reveals a bottle of a stronger alcoholic beverage.
            You smile as you realise that you have not done this for over a year.</p>

            <p>You wake up feeling uncomfortable. Your back hurts. You open your eyes slightly and realise you have fallen asleep on your desk. You slowly rise, feeling the pain in your back slowly dissipate. You move your mouse to wake up the monitor. Your eyes widen as you realise
            you are looking at the code for the about page. There is nothing here, except one line of text that reads "Insert short story about how this grand idea came to be". You feel shocked and confused. You realize what you have just experienced and decide to turn away
            from the monitor, stand up, walk towards the bed, and fall back to sleep. You conclude that all kinds of shit can wait until tomorrow. </p>
